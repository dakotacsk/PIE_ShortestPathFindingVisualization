# **Software Design**

### Software Design

The software for **Hatchling's Quest: Pathfinding Trials** is designed to deliver an intuitive, engaging, and educational gaming experience while visualizing pathfinding algorithms in action.

#### **Software Architecture**

### Software Structure and Key Modules

#### Overview:

The software is divided into three main areas:

- **Game Interface**: Handles the GUI, animations, and user input using **Pygame**.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**:
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (Level 1): Computes shortest paths.
  - **Q-Learning** (Level 2): Enables reward-based navigation.
- **Game Logic**: Manages screens, game states, and leaderboards.

#### Key Modules:

- **`run_game.py`**: Coordinates game flow.
- **`grid/grid.py`**: Defines the pathfinding grid.
- **Pathfinding Modules**:
  - **`sprites/DijkstraSprite.py`**: Implements Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.
  - **`sprites/QLearningSprite.py`**: Implements Q-Learning.
- **Screens**: Main menu, instructions, and interactive gameplay feedback.
- **Leaderboard**: Tracks and displays high scores via **`leaderboard/leaderboard.py`**.

#### **Dependencies**

The software relies on the following external libraries:

- **Python 3.11.7**: Core language used for development.
- **NumPy (2.2.0)**: Used for matrix operations in Q-Learning, including Q-table computations.
- **Pygame (2.6.1)**: Provides the framework for rendering the game interface and managing user input.
