# ECE & Firmware Design

## Final Technical Overview

### Electrical Design

### Firmware Design

Provide details on the firmware (e.g., Arduino logic), including tasks like LED control or input handling.

**PLACEHOLDER**: Add firmware design description.

**Example Snippet**:

```cpp
// Placeholder: LED Button Control Logic
if (buttonPressed) {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
} else {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
}
```
