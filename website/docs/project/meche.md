## Sprint 1

In this sprint, we focused on laying the groundwork for the arcade machine by building prototypes and refining measurements.

### Goals:

1. Create a **functional button box** to test ergonomics.
2. Measure and confirm **dimensions** for key components:
   - Screen placement.
   - Button spacing and height.
3. Test initial assembly techniques, such as using notches and wood glue for connections.

### Challenges:

- Initial measurements needed adjustments to fit the 24”x18” MDF sheets and the monitor size.
- Ergonomic testing led to refinements in button spacing and control panel height.

## Sprint 2

During Sprint 2, we transitioned from prototyping to designing the system in CAD and finalizing its structure.

### Goals:

1. Create detailed **CAD models** of all components.
2. Incorporate features like:
   - A **slanted screen holder** for better ergonomics.
   - A **modular control panel** for easier troubleshooting and maintenance.

### Key Updates:

- CAD models ensured precise alignment and fit for all parts.
- Laser cutter constraints were factored into the design, minimizing material waste.

### Challenges:

- Balancing design complexity with fabrication constraints required iterative adjustments.
- Ensuring all components fit within the laser cutter's dimensions added design constraints.

## Sprint 3

This sprint focused on fabrication, assembly, and resolving challenges encountered during the build process.

### Goals:

1. Cut parts from MDF using **laser cutters**.
2. Paint inner and outer panels using gouache and spray paint, respectively.
3. Assemble the system with **wood glue** and sanded joints for durability.

### Final Updates:

- Successfully assembled the arcade system with modular features for maintenance and upgrades.
- Painted surfaces added durability and aesthetics.

### Challenges:

- **Wood glue issue:** It didn’t adhere well to painted surfaces, requiring joint areas to be sanded for a proper bond.
- Assembly required precision to fit parts seamlessly after adjustments.

## Next Steps

With the mechanical assembly complete, the system is ready for integration with electrical and software components. The focus will shift toward refining usability and ensuring durability in real-world operation.
