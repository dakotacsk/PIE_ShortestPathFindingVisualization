# Mechanical Design

## Final Technical Overview

### Mechanical Design

- **Description**: Provide an overview of the mechanical components, including key design features and specifications.
- **CAD Renderings**:
  - Insert CAD images or renderings here (or link to `assets` if applicable).

### Analysis

- Document any relevant analysis of the mechanical or electrical systems, including:
  - Stress analysis, simulations, or testing results for mechanical systems.
  - Current, voltage, or signal flow analysis for electrical systems.

## Process

### Design Decisions

- Outline the major mechanical and electrical design choices made and why.
- Discuss alternatives considered and how time/budget constraints influenced the final design.

### Challenges

- Highlight challenges encountered in mechanical/electrical development and how they were resolved.

### Progress Timeline

- Provide a short timeline or milestones for mechanical/electrical progress.
